\chapter{Changes in ALC Math Courses}\label{app:sec:alc}
After MTH 20 was moved to the Math SAC, the ALC math courses were the only math courses left in the DE SAC. The ALC math instructors therefore requested that these courses too would be moved to the Math SAC. After the DE and Math SACs gave their support, the courses were moved in January 2013.

Historically, the ALC math courses have only included curriculum up to MTH 65, but after the move was completed, the Math SAC voted to also include MTH 95 curriculum from Fall 2013 on.

Furthermore, the ALC math courses have been impacted by the new no-repeat policy. Historically, these courses could be repeated many times because they included three math levels (now four). Since Winter 2014, each level has their own set of courses. Following is a listing  of the previous and the new/changed courses:
