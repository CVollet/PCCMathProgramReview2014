\chapter{Changes in ALC courses}\label{app:sec:alc}
After MTH 20 was moved to the Math SAC, the ALC Math courses were the only math courses left in the DE SAC. The ALC instructors therefore requested that these courses too would be moved to the Math SAC. After the DE and Math SACs gave their support, the courses were moved in January 2013.

Historically, the ALC math courses have only included curriculum up to MTH 65, but after the move was completed, the Math SAC voted to also include MTH 95 curriculum. The new course forms have been submitted to the Curriculum Committee.

Furthermore, the ALC math courses have been impacted by the new no-repeat policy. Historically, these courses could be repeated many times because they included three levels (now four). Following is a listing  of the current and the new/changed courses:

Current courses:

ALC 60 ``Basic Math Skills Lab''

ALC 61 ``Basic Math Skills Lab''

ALC 62 ``Basic Math Skills Lab''

ALC 63 ``Basic Math Skills Lab''
