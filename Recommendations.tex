\fixthis{comment below}
% In reading the rest of this document yesterday, I would swear you also had
% recommendations about fixing the FT/PT ratio, and about how we support FT and
% PT faculty development.  Did these not link into this Chapter because they
% did not have a subtitle ``Recommendations'' before them to call them out?  

% Another universal issue is that most of your recommendations involve other
% departments stepping up (e.g. advising, testing, etc).  Maybe you could add
% at the end of each of these lines the responsible party for each of these
% recommendations to be actionable?  Then the SLCs for example can jump
% straight to their part and realize that you would really really like them to
% remain open during week 1 as well.

% The second implication of this is that the locus of control on change is
% primarily external to math SAC.  Can you pull the work you are already doing
% to revise DE math into this section as part of your recommendations?  As in,
% math is working on X and Y and Z which will require support in the following
% ways\ldots

% In short, while I like the way you are approaching this section, much is
% missing.  Because this is in some sense the most important section you have,
% the one section that you will be asked to look back to in five years, you
% really ought to tightenit up.
