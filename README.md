PCCMathProgramReview2014
========================

Every five years, Subject Area Committees in the Portland Community College District submit a Program Review to the administration.

The Math SAC has a very large membership with very many things to report in its program review. It's too large for any one person to produce. While faculty are working on content individually and in subcommittees, we will aggregate this content into a multi-file .tex document here.

MathSACProgramReview2014.tex is the hub file for this project. Execute pdflatex on this file to produce the .pdf.
