“In two years, Portland Community College will be nationally known for progress from developmental math to college level courses and completion.”  
- Chris Chairsell, Vice President of Academic and Student Affairs
; Portland Community College Inservice, September 16, 2013


\section{What are the educational goals or objectives of this program/discipline.   How do these compare with national or professional program/discipline trends or guidelines?   Have they changed since the last review, or are they expected to change in the next five years? }

As with any undergraduate or developmental education department, the primary goal of the faculty in the mathematics SAC can be summarized as follows: we hope to support students’ life goals by imparting the skills and cognitive abilities necessary for continued success as they navigate their way through the education system and into the workforce.

As evidenced in the remainder of this document, we have an active faculty who are continually trying innovative strategies to achieve this goal.  Many of these strategies have been targeted directly at increasing student success and completion, such as

Accelerated Math Placement and other placement enhancement tools;
study-skills focused classroom activities;
experimentation with interactive homework/learning systems as well as development of said systems targeted to our students;
establishment and dissemination of best practices for online accessibility.

While each of these are worthy strategies, it has become increasingly apparent that something of greater scope needs to take place if we hope to see dramatic changes in the success and completion rates for students taking mathematics courses - especially those who initially place into developmental math courses.   The call for change nationwide in community colleges from access to access and completion reinforces the Math SAC’s awareness of the vital role we play in creating an environment of student success and completion.  We were pleased to hear Dr. Chairsell call for the creation of a college-wide culture for math success, and we are very encouraged by the way in which this challenge has been embraced by divisions such as student services.  We in the Math SAC also embrace Dr. Chairsell’s call for the creation of a college-wide culture for math success and are dedicated to making the necessary changes to our mathematics curriculum in order to maximize success and completion rates for our students  By necessity, the most dramatic changes will need to take place in our developmental mathematics courses.  As we restructure, we are focused on integrating the evidence-based best practices in order to achieve the highest rates of success and completion for our students. 

Developmental Education (DE)

Historically viewed as “remediation,” developmental education has often been marginalized by higher education entities.  In fact, developmental education demonstrates a core of knowledge that is backed by extensive research.  The two largest organizations involved in developmental education research and professional development, National Council of Developmental Education (NCDE) and National Association of Developmental Education (NADE) define developmental education as “a comprehensive process that focuses on the intellectual, social, and emotional growth and development of all students.”

The number of reasons students place into pre-college courses are too numerous to list. However, a large number of students entering at the DE mathematics level have the added burden of an intense anxiety that hinder their ability to be successful in a mathematics course.  In combination with the academic, social, economic, and psychological issues facing students in DE math courses, we must approach any changes with the whole student in mind.

Over the last several years, there has been a growing sense that the traditional algebra content, as currently taught in our DE math courses, was not meeting the needs of many of our students. The fact that in Fall 2013 over twenty-five SAC members joined the DE Math subcommittee  formed specifically to take a deeper look at developmental math sequence is a strong indicator of the interest and concern we hold.

Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)
Another emerging trend over the past five years has been a nationwide spotlight on STEM education in the past five years and the dire need to increase the number of undergraduates who obtain undergraduate degrees in STEM fields. In fact, increasing the number of undergraduate STEM majors by 1 million over the next decade has been formally designated as a Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) goal by President Obama.  (http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/12/18/one-decade-one-million-more-stem-graduates)

The CAP goal proposes to focus efforts in five promising areas of opportunity:
Identifying and implementing evidence-based practices to improve STEM teaching and to attract students to STEM courses
Providing more opportunities for students to engage in meaningful  STEM activities through research experiences, especially in their first two years of college;
Addressing the mathematics preparation gap that students face when they arrive at college, using evidence-based practices that generate improved results;
Providing educational opportunities and supports for women and historically underrepresented minorities; and
Identifying and supporting innovation in higher education.
The Math SAC realizes that for many students, especially those who enter at the developmental education level, math courses serve as a barrier for students who might otherwise choose to pursue careers in STEM; this is well documented in studies such as PCAST: Engage to Excel (http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/pcast-engage-to-excel-final_feb.pdf ).  As we work to recreate our developmental math curriculum, we are mindful of the need to reform our courses in such a way that they no longer serve as a barrier to pursuit of STEM careers, but for some students actually become a gateway to STEM careers.  Most of the goals stated as CAP “areas of opportunity” include elements that can be addressed in our courses, and we hope to create courses that support attainment of those goals.

In doing this work, we have an eye not only toward students who (ultimately) pursue four-year STEM degrees, but we also have a focus on students enrolled in PCC‘s many CTE programs.  We are committed to creating courses that support success and completion for students enrolled in CTE programs.  Our courses must not only promote successful completion of the math course, but they must also must impart skills that are specifically needed by the students in their CTE courses (and ultimately in their chosen careers).


The future of DE and Undergraduate Math at PCC
While we are still in conversation, some themes have begun to emerge. Preliminary discussions have transpired that might lead us to

revamp our developmental education courses with an emphasis on evidence-based best practices;
streamline the developmental education sequence;
create developmental education sequences which support STEM education and, ideally, promotes STEM education;
integrate content into our developmental math courses that will create a math literate populace (intelligent consumers of data and problem solvers);
track our progress through data-analysis and assessment that ensures that completion measures of  pass/fail rates do not mask a decrease in quality education.

While our current focus is on DE and STEM, we are also mindful of the need to reexamine our undergraduate level courses. The content and teaching practices we adopt for our developmental  ed courses need to be created with a clear understanding of the potential effects those changes will have on the students enrolled in our undergraduate level courses. Additionally, we need to ensure that our commitment to using evidence-based best practices makes its way into the classroom for all of our courses, not just our developmental education courses.

We are excited by this opportunity to restructure our courses in ways that better support student success and completion. We realize that this change cannot be developed or implemented in isolation and we look forward to discussing our ideas for DE restructure at the program review meeting. We look forward as well to and having ongoing collaborative conversations with all stakeholders including, yet not limited to, administration, CTE faculty, advising, counseling, testing, student services, union representatives, and - ultimately - the students themselves.
