“In two years, Portland Community College will be nationally known for progress from developmental math to college level courses and completion.”  
- Chris Chairsell, Vice President of Academic and Student Affairs
; Portland Community College Inservice, September 16, 2013


\section{What are the educational goals or objectives of this program/discipline.   How do these compare with national or professional program/discipline trends or guidelines?   Have they changed since the last review, or are they expected to change in the next five years? }

As with any undergraduate or developmental education department, the primary goal of the faculty in the mathematics SAC can be summarized as follows: we hope to support students’ life goals by imparting the skills and cognitive abilities necessary for continued success as they navigate their way through the education system and into the workforce.

As evidenced in the remainder of this document, we have an active faculty who are continually trying innovative strategies to achieve this goal.  Many of these strategies have been targeted directly at increasing student success and completion, such as

Accelerated Math Placement and other placement enhancement tools;
study-skills focused classroom activities;
experimentation with interactive homework/learning systems as well as development of said systems targeted to our students;
establishment and dissemination of best practices for online accessibility.

While each of these are worthy strategies, it has become increasingly apparent that something of greater scope needs to take place if we hope to see dramatic changes in the success and completion rates for students taking mathematics courses - especially those who initially place into developmental math courses.   The call for change nationwide in community colleges from access to access and completion reinforces the Math SAC’s awareness of the vital role we play in creating an environment of student success and completion.  We were pleased to hear Dr. Chairsell call for the creation of a college-wide culture for math success, and we are very encouraged by the way in which this challenge has been embraced by divisions such as student services.  We in the Math SAC also embrace Dr. Chairsell’s call for the creation of a college-wide culture for math success and are dedicated to making the necessary changes to our mathematics curriculum in order to maximize success and completion rates for our students  By necessity, the most dramatic changes will need to take place in our developmental mathematics courses.  As we restructure, we are focused on integrating the evidence-based best practices in order to achieve the highest rates of success and completion for our students. 

Developmental Education (DE)

Historically viewed as “remediation,” developmental education has often been marginalized by higher education entities.  In fact, developmental education demonstrates a core of knowledge that is backed by extensive research.  The two largest organizations involved in developmental education research and professional development, National Council of Developmental Education (NCDE) and National Association of Developmental Education (NADE) define developmental education as “a comprehensive process that focuses on the intellectual, social, and emotional growth and development of all students.”

The number of reasons students place into pre-college courses are too numerous to list. However, a large number of students entering at the DE mathematics level have the added burden of an intense anxiety that hinder their ability to be successful in a mathematics course.  In combination with the academic, social, economic, and psychological issues facing students in DE math courses, we must approach any changes with the whole student in mind.

Over the last several years, there has been a growing sense that the traditional algebra content, as currently taught in our DE math courses, was not meeting the needs of many of our students. The fact that in Fall 2013 over twenty-five SAC members joined the DE Math subcommittee  formed specifically to take a deeper look at developmental math sequence is a strong indicator of the interest and concern we hold.

Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)
Another emerging trend over the past five years has been a nationwide spotlight on STEM education in the past five years and the dire need to increase the number of undergraduates who obtain undergraduate degrees in STEM fields. In fact, increasing the number of undergraduate STEM majors by 1 million over the next decade has been formally designated as a Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) goal by President Obama.  (http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/12/18/one-decade-one-million-more-stem-graduates)

The CAP goal proposes to focus efforts in five promising areas of opportunity:
Identifying and implementing evidence-based practices to improve STEM teaching and to attract students to STEM courses
Providing more opportunities for students to engage in meaningful  STEM activities through research experiences, especially in their first two years of college;
Addressing the mathematics preparation gap that students face when they arrive at college, using evidence-based practices that generate improved results;
Providing educational opportunities and supports for women and historically underrepresented minorities; and
Identifying and supporting innovation in higher education.

The Math SAC realizes that for many students entering at the developmental education level, math courses serve as a barrier for those who might otherwise choose to pursue careers in STEM; this is well documented in studies such as PCAST: Engage to Excel (http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/pcast-engage-to-excel-final_feb.pdf ).  As we work to recreate our developmental math curriculum, we are mindful of the need to reform our courses in such a way that they no longer serve as a barrier to the success of our students, but that they also serve as a gateway to STEM careers for students who may have steered away from math in the past.  Most of the goals stated as CAP “areas of opportunity” include elements that can be addressed in our courses, and we hope to create courses that support attainment of those goals.

In doing this work, we have an eye not only toward students who (ultimately) pursue four-year STEM degrees, but we also have a focus on students enrolled in PCC‘s many CTE programs.  We are committed to creating courses that support success and completion for students enrolled in CTE programs.  Our courses must not only promote successful completion of the math course, but they must also must impart skills that are specifically needed by the students in their CTE courses (and ultimately in their chosen careers).


The future of DE and Undergraduate Math at PCC
While we are still in conversation, some themes have begun to emerge. Preliminary discussions have transpired that might lead us to

revamp our developmental education courses with an emphasis on evidence-based best practices;
streamline the developmental education sequence;
create developmental education sequences which support STEM education and, ideally, promotes STEM education;
integrate content into our developmental math courses that will create a math literate populace (intelligent consumers of data and problem solvers);
track our progress through data-analysis and assessment that ensures that completion measures of  pass/fail rates do not mask a decrease in quality education.

While our current focus is on DE and STEM, we are also mindful of the need to reexamine our undergraduate level courses. The content and teaching practices we adopt for our developmental  ed courses need to be created with a clear understanding of the potential effects those changes will have on the students enrolled in our undergraduate level courses. Additionally, we need to ensure that our commitment to using evidence-based best practices makes its way into the classroom for all of our courses, not just our developmental education courses.

We are excited by this opportunity to restructure our courses in ways that better support student success and completion. We realize that this change cannot be developed or implemented in isolation and we look forward to discussing our ideas for DE restructure at the program review meeting. We look forward as well to and having ongoing collaborative conversations with all stakeholders including, yet not limited to, administration, CTE faculty, advising, counseling, testing, student services, union representatives, and - ultimately - the students themselves.

\section{Please summarize changes that have been made since the last review.  }
\section{Were any of the changes made as a result of the last review? If so, please describe the rationale and result.  }

In the 2003-2008 Program Review (PR) and the corresponding Administrative Response (AR) a large number of recommendations were given from the Math SAC and the Administration.  This section will look at changes that have been made due to those recommendations and some recommendations that are still being addressed.

One of the recommendations from the 2003-2008 PR (page 30) was to transfer MTH 20 from the Developmental Education department to the Mathematics department.  That change has taken effect starting Fall 2013.  The change helped to align Sylvania with the rest of the campuses as to how this course was viewed.   Due to lack of resources (at other campuses) MTH 20 was, for all practical purposes, under the jurisdiction of the Math department.  Due to this change instructors teaching ALC math courses asked to also be incorporated into the Math department, housing all math courses under one legislative body.  The move was completed as of January 2013 (See appendix – ALC Classes)

The AR gave a list of recommendations (page 3) relating to alternative methods of moving students through the math sequence and accelerated math sequences.  In response to this recommendation MTH 07, 08 Accelerated Math Review (See appendix – Creation of Two Accelerated Review Courses) were created by the Math SAC.  Now that these classes are available we are hoping to offer more sections.  This will require more advertising when students are placed into a math class.  Additionally since the ALC classes have been moved into the Math SAC the math faculty has become more aware of these courses.  The ALC classes were once only available at Sylvania, but now South East Center has incorporated the sequence and other campuses are looking into it.

Page 2 of the AR asks the Math SAC to look at assessment more and take our Course Outcomes to the next level.  Please see question number 2 in this PR for details, but we have made major improvements on this front and have a standing assessment committee and action committee.  Some of our faculty members have roles in the college wide assessment strategies.

The success rates for MTH 91 and 92 and additionally MTH 61, 62, and 63 were mentioned on page 2 of the AR.  After looking at the success rates of MTH 91 and 92, the Math SAC no longer offers these sections.   MTH 61, 62, and 63 are still being offered but the Math SAC continues to work on Developmental Math and we currently has two committees looking at Math Pathways.

Page 28 of the PR recommended that an orientation to ‘Studying at college’ be part of the general orientation process.  Since the college is yet to make changes in this area, Jessica Benards created study skills videos and activities that are currently being used my math faculty in Developmental Math Classes.

A recommendation in the PR (page 31) wanted department chairs to look at math 105's low enrollment.  Since then MTH 111 B and C were merged into single 111 class and the numbers of 105 have increased.  Additionally two committees are currently looking at math pathways from the precollege classes that might also increase 105 numbers.  This change also led to the adoption on a new MTH 111 book.  Normally changing a book wouldn’t merit mention in a PR, but this book has a different philosophy and has therefore added additional changes to the college level math sequence.

A large number of recommendations from the last PR (pages 32-34) are related to Distance Learning.  We currently have a DL standing committee that looks into these matters.  See section 3A of this review for a list of changes and concerns that the Distance Learning Standing Committee is currently working on.

The last PR (pages 30-31) made suggestions related to faculty contact with students outside the classroom and in the learning center.  The math faculty has continued to support the learning center over the last 5 years.  At Cascade Campus the math faculty have been working with retention specialists by creating academic interventions for students of concern.  This program shows promise and the specialists now have an office in the math department and 3 staff members.
