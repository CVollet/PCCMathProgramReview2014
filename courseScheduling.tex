\chapter{Course Scheduling Pattern (by campus)}\label{sec:app:courseschedule}
\section{Cascade}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item  Scheduling is term by term, which helps us adjust to enrollment changes and part-time faculty changes.
	\item  Class size for all Cascade math classes is capped at 35 (if room allows) except MTH 20/61/62/63, which are capped at 30.
	\item  Since the last program review, we have regularly offered many more MWF classes, especially for MTH 95, in order to try to improve retention and success.  MWF classes, meeting for shorter times than typical MW/TuTh classes, enable us to “pack” more classes into a school day and therefore maximize our usage of the rooms we are assigned.
	\item  We discontinued MTH 91/92 because we felt that the sequence was inadequately preparing students for MTH 111.
	\item  We continued to innovate with regard to hybrid offerings, including weekday and Saturday hybrids.
	\item  We eliminated Sunday hybrids when Cascade decided to eliminate Sunday class offerings.  Since we were beginning to see declines in enrollment anyway, this did not seriously impact student access to classes.  The Saturday hybrids are still available.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Rock Creek}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Rock Creek schedules term by term.  It would help with staffing decisions if the classes would be assigned rooms well ahead of the date the class offerings become visible to students online and the deadline for the photograph proof of the paper class schedule.
	\item Rock Creek offers mostly two day a week classes (82\%) meeting from 7am to 9  pm, about 10\% one day a week either Saturday or Friday mornings, and 8\% online.
	\item Rock Creek schedules courses at the Hillsboro Center, Willow Creek Center and St Helens  (12\% of class offerings at RC).
\end{enumerate}

\section{Sylvania}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item  Scheduling is done one year ahead, which helps students plan out their year
	\item  Coordination between campuses for low enrollment or specialty courses 
	\item  Newberg Center, scheduled by Sylvania, gives more students better access 
	\item  Increased offering of Distance Learning courses also increases accessibility for 
	students with scheduling conflicts
	\item  Class size for all Sylvania math classes is capped at 34 (if room allows) except
	Statistics (23-28 for computer classrooms)
	\item  Reorganized time slots for 2013/14 to lower possibility of canceled classes (due 
	to room availability or low enrollment)
\end{enumerate}
